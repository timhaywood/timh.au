      <h1>Motion Design as UX</h1>
      <p>
        When I joined Google I didn't have much experience doing UI motion
        design, so it's been an interesting learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>So far, two things have stood out to me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's a UX role</li>
        <li>Implementation matters, not your renders</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>UX role</h2>
      <p>Outside of UI, when animating your main concern is how it looks. Getting the easing curves right, conveying the story</p>
