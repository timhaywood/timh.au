      <h1>The handoff myth</h1>
      <p>
        It seems there's always software being worked on to remove
        designer/developed handoff, from Dreamweaver to more modern tools like
        Framer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always felt these were worthy and interesting pursuits, often
        leading to greet tools (such as Webflow).
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've worked more on product teams, I've also come to appreciate
        another perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visual design, user experience, motion and engineering aren't stages of
        a process with handoffs between - but rather perspectives to look at a
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        People with these skill sets work on a product simultaneously, with
        their unique perspective, using the software they're most comfortable
        with.
      </p>
      <p>
        They constantly handoff between each other, and it's in these small,
        regular handoffs that I think the most effective improvements are done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over optimizing for a single handoff between people can lead to more
        difficulties, as the inevitable smaller updates continue to happen.
      </p>
