      <h1>Motion as state transitions</h1>
      <p>
        When animating a video, you can think of an animations as a function of
        time. As time increases, like in a video player or your After Effects
        timeline, your animation progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        When doing motion for interfaces, your animations are driven by state,
        not time.
      </p>
      <p>This is a fundamental change in the way you think as an animator.</p>

      <p>A few differences that come to mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There will probably be more states to transition between then you
          think, look out for edge cases
        </li>
        <li>Transitions can be intercepted or cancelled</li>
        <li>
          You might need to take into account what triggered the state change,
          such as a tap vs gesture
        </li>
      </ul>
