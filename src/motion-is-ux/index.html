      <h1>Motion Design is UX</h1>
      <p>
        There's a few things that stood out to me when transitioning into UI
        motion design, one of them being that it's really UX role.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an animator in other areas, your goal is to make great looking motion
        that serves the story.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the world of UI, your goal is to create a great user experience,
        using motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is done, in part, by transitioning between states in a way that
        makes things clear to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the work is in understanding the relationship between these
        states, so you can animate transitions that help clarify these
        relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to do this with a user focused perspective. Rather than
        focusing on the motion itself, focusing on how the motion affects the
        users experience of the software.
